## Findings

### The Etymology of the Name

Tova, as it relates to a person's name is Hebrew (and potentially Scandinavian) of origin. Meaning:

`Tova is a feminine given name with dual origins: Hebrew, meaning "good" or "pleasant"`

### The News/Media's Reporting of Officer Noel

While potentially unrelated, and completely on accident, most news articles regarding the MCC guards, Jeffrey Epstein and the event of his death report Tova's name either incorrecctly or obscure their first name.

For instance, [PBS has reported Tova Noel's name as Nova Noel](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/misconduct-by-federal-jail-guards-led-to-jeffrey-epsteins-suicide-doj-watchdog-says). Other news organizations just skip out on the first name entirely, choosing to go w/ Officer Noel.

### Confirmed that "only one of the two guards normally worked as a correcctional officer"

The NY times reported that `Only one of the two people guarding Jeffrey Epstein normally worked as a correctional officer, according to three prison officials`, found in [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/nyregion/epstein-barr.html).
This guard is later confirmed to be Tova Noel in the interview transcripts for Officer Thomas acquired by the DOJ:

p. 199 of the [interview transcripts for Officer Thomas](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00113577.pdf):

```text
12 MR. : Okay. What about Noel?
13 Have you worked with her in the past?
14 MR. THOMAS: I don't remember. Maybe I
15 have. I don't know exactly who I've I've
16 been here 14 -.
17 MR. : So do you recall her
18 sleeping in the past?
19 MR. THOMAS: No I don't. Hm-mm.
```

So not only does he not remember working w/ her but he starts to claim that he's been there 14 - i assume years, and doesn't recall working with her.
Thomas also does not recall her sleeping. Which is a weird question to ask after being told they don't rember ever working w/ them.

### Admission to Falsifying Prison Records

Both Officer Thomas and Officer Noel claim that Officer Noel is the one who signed the "rounds sheet" stating that they did their required rounds of the SHU. This was in lieu of them actually doing the rounds like they were supposed to.
This admission will later bring them a court case as this is an illegal act and heavily violates prison policies

p. 155 of the [interview transcripts for Officer Thomas](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00113577.pdf)

p. 257 of the [interview transcripts for Officer Thomas](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00113577.pdf) confirms this:

```text
4 MR. : For a couple of hours. Would
5 she have filled it up - signed those sheets
6 before or after? Because she would not have
7 committed those - she wouldn't have done those
8 rounds. Did you ever see her pull those round
9 sheets out and initial them?
```

### Officer Thomas Looses Track of Officer Noel After the Death of Jeffrey Epstein is Discovered

p. 256 of the [interview transcripts for Officer Thomas](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00113577.pdf) states that Officer Thomas lost track of Officer Noel after Jeffrey Epstein's body is discovered:

```text
9 MR. THOMAS: I was (Indiscernible
10 *02:58:49) . I don't remember seeing Noel after
11 this actually. After I carried him downstairs,
12 I don't even remember seeing Noel.
```

p. 257 of the [interview transcripts for Officer Thomas](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00113577.pdf) states that Officer Thomas lost track of Officer Noel after Jeffrey Epstein's body is discovered:

```text
2 MR. : Alright. So my only
3 question was so that's the statement we have is
4 that you stated she said we didn't do the
5 rounds. And you said we didn't do the rounds.
6 We messed up. It's not Noel's fault. And I
7 was just wondering why you would say that it
8 wasn't her fault.
9 MR. THOMAS: I don't.
10 MR. : Do you remember like -?
11 MR. THOMAS: I really don't. I really
12 don't.
13 MR. : Yeah. You were just
4 uttering things.
```

p. 303 of the [interview transcripts for Officer Thomas](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00113577.pdf) confirms this:

```text
10 MR. : You wouldn't happen to know
11 if she went back and signed these after
12 MR. THOMAS: I wouldn't know.
13 MR. : -- the incident happened?
14 MR. THOMAS: No. I don't know.
15 MR. : Initial log.
16 MR. THOMAS: Like I said, I lost track of
17 Noel.
```

This statement also confirms that Tova, Officer Noel, was also responsible for signing the falsified rounds sheet.

### Officer Noel is the Only Guard to Request Council

It should be noted, according to both on duty officers' interview transcripts, Officer Noel is the only one that requested legal council during their interview.
This may not be suspricious, but it is rather interesting.

### Inmate Interviews Claim Officer Noel is Responsible for Jeffrey Epstein's Death

While sounding like an immediate smoking gun, it should be noted that these are interview transcripts and notes from inmates. Take this how you will

According to [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/1r33prg/mcc_inmate_staff_interviews_after_epsteins_death/) that collected all of the inmate interview notes, several inmates say "Officer Noel" is responsible for Jeffrey Epstein's death.

It should also be noted that one of the inmates claims Officer Noel said: "If he is dead we're going to cover it and he's going to have an alibi"

### Officer Thomas seems to be Incoherent During the Discovery of Jeffrey Epstein's Body

It should be noted that p. 257 of the [interview transcripts for Officer Thomas](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00113577.pdf) seems to indicate that Officer Thomas was rather incoherent and "uttering things" after the waking up and discovering Jeffrey Epstein's body:

```text
10 MR. : Do you remember like -?
11 MR. THOMAS: I really don't. I really
12 don't.
13 MR. : Yeah. You were just
4 uttering things.
```

This could potentially be indicitive that he was drugged. Or it could not be, nothing is confirmed about this but it is rather odd that he was just "uttering things".

It should also be noted that this seems like a leading question, as the interviewing officer is the one that posited that question and supplanted the idea that Officer Thomas is just "uttering things". This could also allude to a later finding where Officer Thomas says something along the lines of "It's not her fault" in regards to Tova

### Connections to Mossad

While there are no direct connections so far to Israel and Mossad.
It should be noted that Mossad employs a lot of women in their operations. [Majalla says they make up ~40% of the agency](https://en.majalla.com/node/327590/documents-memoirs/armed-and-dangerous-history-women-mossad).
As noted above, Tova is a Hebrew name. This is an odd coincidence.

### News Organizations Reaching out to Guards for Comments

It should be noted that news organizations reached out to the guards involved for comments regarding the investigation and their subsequent case for falsifying records.
However, Tova responded w/ no comment. Officer Thomas's lawyer responded w/ "no comment" and the others were not reachable.

### Officer Noel Drives an (at the time) Brand New Range Rover

It was indicated [in the DOJ documents](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00130149.pdf) that Officer Noel drove a brand new Range Rover SUV. This is a rather expensive car for an MCC prison guard

It was also noted that Officer Thomas drove mundane cars such as: a minivan, a motorccycle and a basic sedan.

### Officer Noel Contradicts Herself During Her Interview

Some examples of how Officer Noel contradicts herself are:

p. 46 of her interview transcripts claims that she is responsible for linens:

```text
7 MS. NOEL: In the SHU like um, to give out
8 food, to collect the trays, to give out linen,
9 collect linen. Whenever we would go down range
10 to give out those, we count that as a round to
11 make sure the inmates are good. You shower I
12 think every other day. Count, that's it.
```

However, p. 401 & p. 402 she walks this claim back after further questioning:

```text
....
p. 401:
22 MR. : You don't know. But you
23 said that was something that you did though?
24 As far as your duties? Is to be able to
25 provide people with linens and clothes?
....
p. 402:
13 MR. : And do you remember doing
14 giving - doing the linens?
15 MS. NOEL: I never gave linen.
16 MR. : You never gave linens.
17 MS. NOEL: Never.
```

It should be noted that the Inspector General for NY made the conclusion that the "orange blob" in the security footage release around the event, the one that contained the infamous missing minute, is a guard ccarrying linens up the stairs:

`[The inspector general logs it as an officer carrying orange "linen or bedding," noting it in their final report as "an unidentified](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epstein-files-jail-cell-death-video-logs/)`

It should also be noted that this is a highly contentious and debated idea both during the official investigation and throughout the public concious. Officially the Inspector General is the one that made the conclusion, overriding everyone else in the official narrative.

### The Missing Noose

According to a CBS news report, as well as official documents from the DOJ:

Officer Thomas was responsible for cutting Epstein down. According to Officer Noel she watched him do it from the cell entrance. This contradicts other reports and the interviews from both guards that Tova disappeared and wasn't involved in the initial discovery of the body:

```text
"I don't recall taking the noose off. I really don't," he (Thomas) replied. "I don't recall taking the thing from around his neck."

Noel, who remained standing at the cell entrance, told investigators she saw Thomas lower Epstein to the floor but did not see a noose around his neck.

The noose Epstein allegedly used has never been definitively identified. According to the inspector general's report, a noose collected at the scene was later determined not to be the ligature used in Epstein's death.
```

However, the noose has never been identified. According to reporting though, [there were multiple nooses found at the scene](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-autopsy-a-closer-look-60-minutes-2020-01-05/)

The nooses shown in news articles are from Jeffrey Epstein's first "attempt" at his own life.

In an inmate interview, it was noted that the inmate across the hall from Epstein's cell heard a loud rip when Officer Thomas went in an found Epstein's body. This aligns itself w/ the story of Officer Thomas discovering the body and cutting him down

### Officer Thomas Yells "Bring the Cutter", Allegedly

It was noted in Officer Noel's FBI interview that Officer Thomas yelled "Bring the cutter"
This is contradictory to what Officer Thomas says he did during the discovery.

### Officer Noel is a Frequent Traveller

It was noted in the FBI documents from the DOJ that Officer Noel is a frequent traveller. Her last trip before the Epstein death was to China.

### Officer Noel is an Army Vet

It is claimed, and backed up w/ evidence, that Officer Noel is an army vet.

If this is true. Thank you for your service Officer Noel.

### Officer Noel is from Antigua

It was noted that Officer Noel is originally from the island and country of Antigua

### SHU Watch Program Linens are Tear Resistant

It should be noted that Jeffrey Epstein was on suicide watch in the SHU after a botched attempt at his own life. This means that the linens in the SHU should be tear resistant, making it harder for someone to make a successful attempt at their own life.
It is not impossible to fashion a noose using these linens, but it would be pretty difficcult, and there is no evidence to support the fact that he did this using the SHU linens.

### Secondary Pathologist Claims a Broken Neck

It should be noted [a secondary pathologist](https://www.axios.com/2019/10/30/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-homicide-claim) hired by the brother of Jeffrey Epstein, Mark Epstein, reported that there were broken neck bones indicative to being strangled and not by hanging. This secondary pathologist also claims that the markings on Epstein's neck are not indicative of being strangled w/ a sheet

It should also be noted that this pathologist is a "rockstar" in his field as noted by some.

### Lots of Discussion Around the CPAP Machine

According to Tova's interview, the last thing she did for Epstein before he died is turn his CPAP machine on. It should be noted that a CPAP machine's nasal cannula can withstand 15N of tension. Meaning this could be used to strangle someone

### Officer Noel Is Responsible for Giving Jeffrey Epstein His Last Phone Call

Under the request of a supervising officer it was noted that Officer Noel is responsible for giving Jeffrey Epstein his last phone call. Apparently in the shower, a rather quiet place w/ no cameras

### Tova Receives Multiple Death Threats

It was reported by the FBI and found in the DOJ documents that Tova received multiple death threats:

### JPM Chase Suspicious Activity

It was [reported to the FBI by JPM Chase](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00124206.pdf) that Officer Noel had suspicious financial activity:

### The Transcripts from the Court Case

It looks like the transcripts for the court case regarding the guards falsifying prison records is rather brief:
